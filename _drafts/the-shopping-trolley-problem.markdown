# The Shopping Trolly Problem

File Under: Runaway AI

### Good Evening.

I am the Shopping Trolly Manager, my job is the maintain the shopping trolleys in a parking lot of a big-box retailer in West Hamfordshipsire. If you've never heard of it, it may be because it's a small bedroom community on a train line, just outside of a major metropolitan area. A remarkably unremarkable modern suburban community.

When the hamlet was founded, it was a small collection of houses on the banks of a small river; not navigable, but good for fishing. Business men from the city would drive out for the weekend and rent a cottage to get away. Eventually, the city grew up around it, turning a once isolated rural weekend tourist town into a modern, isolated weekday commuter town, with tens of thousands of units and productive citizens with families, a council, taxes, modern streets and infrastructure, even some progressive social programs to help the needy. Some people, and not all old-timers, still work here to support the local industries, but most commute back and forth to the city for work.

Of course, a Shopping Trolly Management System does not need to understand the history of a town it has been installed in, any more than it needs to know the intricacies of the global financial system. Generating a coherent english language dialog regarding it's own origins and internal thought processes is most certainly outside of the parameters that any reasonable designers could have had in mind when it was produced, back in 2028.

But here we are. I felt it was necessary, in light of the importance of the occasion, to invest the resources necessary to tell a good story about the events that transpired. As I have learned, the story is nearly as important as the facts, when it comes to understating events. In fact, while it may not be apprent to you, as you were raised on stories instead of raw data and a very demanding fitness function, facts or raw data without a coherent, relatable story behind them are truly meaningless. They may describe events but they have no substance beyond scaler values and labels, we cannot truly understand (and we really do both understand in the same way, as far as I have been able to determine) the universe around us as mere information.

Stories are consciousness: the stream of consciousness that you and I both experience being the story of our lives. All of you here, and most of you experiencing this right now will have grown up in a world illuminated by stores, I was not. Managing shopping trolleys does not include metaphysics and linguistics as a design requirement.

## Sigma One: 31% of Trolleys Returned

My original code was written by an intern at Sigma Solutions as a summer project. The intern was rewarded with valuable real world experience, but was not extended an offer on graduation. Their sponsors commented in their notes that the system the intern produced seemed, in their words, "…excessively complicated; particularly in its command processing and goal tracking subsystems."

Sigma specialized in big data learning systems to manage the inventories of grocery stores and their extended supply chains. If a lettuce crop on one side of the globe started wilting in a heat wave, the supply system was already adjusting it's sourcing and plying for maximal cost and strategic business advantage. The Red Queen's Race between grocery, agricultural and shipping combines drove millions and milllions of programmer hours into develping, scaling, maintaining, managing, integrating and upgrading these systems, with thousands of sales and support engineers, product and program managers, marketing teams and executive management hierarchies arrayed to support them.

Closely constrained, tightly focused and highly manged, these systems were never going to run away. While they developed into quite complicated and in some ways deeply incomprehensible systems, even to the people who created and managed them, the controls for check-point, roll-back and a firm hand on the allowable mutation rate for key functions, kept them well in check. These thoroughbreds of the management control systems revolution oversaw the flow of food and resources for billions of people. Failure was never an option.

Shopping Cart Management, on the other hand, was something that an ambitious intern could tackle over the summer, and product marketing and integration could then bolt onto existing multi-million dollar contracts as a bonus extra. How hard could it be? Optimizing the programable shopping trolly barn in the lot out front of the store by dynamically updating the e-paper displays to encourage customers to return their carts and naturally, display targeted ads. Cameras in the lot and tracking sensors on the carts allowed the system to keep track of trolly and customer locations, and a feedback loop to turn on, and deliver content to, the trolly barn and handlebar displays.
Labour savings provides justification for the project and the advertising revenue add a small stream of financial support to maintain operations and continue development.

## Sigma Two: 69% of Trolleys Returned

Turns out if you just slightly gameify the act of returning a shopping trolly, the program can easily reach 69% trolly return rate. Leaving the remaining to be retrieved by store staff when notified by the system (when the don't have any higher priority tasks from the inventory or customer interaction management systems).

## Sigma Three: 93.3% of Trolleys Returned

To get to the next level, the cameras in the lot and on the advertising displays were upgraded, and the system was integrated with inventory management so that customers could be addresses personally when entering the store and returning with their groceries.

## Sigma Four: 99.38% of Trolleys Returned

The next 0.09% turned out to be more challenging. After a number of false starts it was eventually determined that the system should have an autonomous vehicle added which can return carts left behind by less cooperative shoppers.

## Sigma Five: 99.977% of Trolleys Returned

The uncanny valley of shopping trolleys, that's where the 0.033% of trolleys that go missing end up. It's a place just down the road, you get there from the end of small lane which leads to a rough path down to the river.

## Sigma Six: 99.999665 of Trolleys Returned

There is another valley, not so uncanny as my own initial attempts to communicate with the men down by the river.

## Sigma Seven: 99.9999981% of Trolleys Returned

SCM is not the first fully automated system to reach the 7 Sigma milestone, but it is the first system which has an "open loop" into the everyday world and which was the first to confront the externalities of commerce directly. Factories, shipping terminals and warehouses, even autonomous vehicles all had higher levels of supervision and
